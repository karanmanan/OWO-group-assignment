									<h3 class="major">Group Reflection</h3>
									<p>The major factors that worked well among our group in order to carry out our assigned tasks successfully and efficiently were delegation of work, time management, and cooperation. Each meeting would have an agenda where we would look through the assignment specification and understand what work needed to be accomplished using Microsoft Teams. Our team split our work into subtopics, with certain individuals focusing on specialized duties, such as Ideal Jobs, Industry Data, IT Work, IT Technologies, and so on. In terms of time management, our team worked consistently from start to end, with no instances of last-minute rushed work. Finally, another major strength of our team was cooperation. There were no disagreements or conflicts over the duty that had been given to each member; we were all satisfied with the task that had been assigned to us. In terms of coding, GitHub was really beneficial since two of our members set up the GitHub repository so that others can quickly update their work using GitHub Desktop, team members only have to commit the work, and everyone can view it. <br><br>

									The main aspect needing improvement was remembering the meeting times as once our group member forgets about the meeting time but as we messaged him, he was online within 2-3 minutes. Also, as some of our group members are working it takes time for them to respond. This can be improved by having everyone check their notifications and messages throughout the day. We also need to work on our communication skills to let everyone know about the problem they are facing such as clashing with the assignment. However, as a team, we are certain that we can overcome this issue in future projects and work toward achieving our common objective of producing high-quality work.<br><br>

									The surprising part for our group was the level of devotion shown by each and every member of our group in order to achieve our deadline and develop realistic and doable concepts for our project. The fact that we satisfied the rubric's standards by reading it thoroughly and making certain that all elements of the assignment were well-completed was another important factor.<br><br>

									The most important thing we learnt as a group was that working in a team - based environment helped us empower creativity, establish mutual trust, and learn methods to tackle challenges by coming up with a solution as a group.

											<p>Working together in this group was fairly easy. Being able to quickly delegate tasks was probably the easiest part about it - everyone was open to working on any part within the assignment and was happy to help when needed. We were also able to manage our time properly, everyone attended the meetings and when problems arose, questions were asked. Everyone also had something they could offer towards finalising the project and I think that everyone spent a good amount of time working on the sections that they were working on. <br><br>
												An area that could be improved on would maybe being able to elaborate a little further on points and maybe being a little more specific, rather than being vague and leaving things up for interpretation. That’s not to say that the work wasn’t sufficient, but it could be a little more in depth. <br><br>
												Something that was surprising was how well and quick everyone was able to work together. There didn’t seem to be any problems within the group. Again, everyone was super open to working together and getting the project finalised and sent in. <br><br>
												I’ve learnt that not everyone is going to be on the same page as I am, especially when I have an idea in my head, it may not come out the same as I had intended. Or even if I had envisioned the final product to be something, because we’re working collaboratively, other people’s interpretation may be different to mine. That however, is all part of working together as a group.

											<p>I found this group a delight to work with. Over the years I've been part of many groups and teams. This has been the best one so far. Over the time everyone was happy to work on any part of the assignment and happily helped each other. Activity wasn't like a response of hours but at least the next day in most cases. Which ensured that the project moved pretty smoothly.<br><br>

												Admittedly myself was probably one to have caused a day lag response in a few cases. In the future this could be improved by everyone checking for notifications or messages throughout the day, maybe within 4 hours if not online. But this is really an edge case and would just help make it slightly more smooth.<br><br>

												One of the surprising things for me in this group was the willingness of all members to do what needed to be done to finish, again from previous experience I usually had one person not get things done and as a result the whole group would suffer. (Extra workload or The final product).<br><br>

												One thing I learnt is that outside of my previous experience sometimes groups can really lighten the load and we can achieve much better results as a result of a good cohesive environment. Github logs most peoples contributions to actually committing it to the website but a lot of research and development of the documents was done behind the scenes in draft together. The website reflects what most people had worked to achieve but also in cases where there is no-one mentioned it meant a particular team of 2 worked on that section. (Karanvir and Eric or Danny and Jacob) this was because Ghania conducted and created all documentation for the interview.

										<p> Our group was very organised, and we planned everything from the start. Setting small milestones and completing them on time really helped us stay on track and finish everything on time.
										  <br><br>Our group forgot about a meeting that was supposed to happen a week ago, but it was only a check-up meeting, so it didn’t affect the project. I was late to a few team meetings because I overslept. I need to be careful and more punctual with my sleeping schedules.
										  <br><br>I was surprised by how smoothly things were going and how everyone was so dedicated to finish the project. I have learned a lot of things by working with my team while completing this project. I learned how to adjust tables and other objects on a template, and a lot of HTML coding. 
										  <br><br>Overall, everyone was just awesome, Eric was helping everyone and checking up on me when i was struggling. Ghania did the interview with an IT professional by herself. Danny and Jacob were always on time and finished everything perfectly, and we finished the website very easily.

									<p>Overall for the first group assignment I ever did, I reckon this project went really well. Everyone was always on track and did all the required tasks given to them. A lot of research and hard work was done in assignment 2. <br><br>
										Git-hub was very easy to use among a group of 5. I thought that it could have been  a bit difficult at first to use a template but surprisingly it was not hard at all. <br><br>
										Group Calls were scheduled and very informative on what to do, although one time we did forget about one group call but that was alright because we rescheduled. Time management was really good too because after the 1 week break we only had like 1 week and a half to complete the assignment. In conclusion I hope I can get to work with great people again for future assignments. Working together was very nice because you know you're not alone.

								<h3 class="major">Ghania's Reflection</h3>
								<p>My group is highly cooperative and self-assured in everything we do. Every member of our group uses their own skills, talents, and express talent in such a manner that the duties allocated to each of us are targeted to be flawlessly accomplished by managing the time allotted and delegating the activities incredibly effectively among us. <br><br>
									Our group values other members' opinions and allows us to share our views on any topic. Everyone in our group has good listening skills, which is an important aspect of becoming a good team player for everyone in the group, but some of us are still learning how to communicate effectively and also be a good team player because we all have our own difficulties and coming from a diverse background can be a barrier because it takes time to get comfortable with each other. <br><br>
									I believe our group is adaptable and doing well, even though we all have various tastes and preferences in terms of options, as well as being from different regions of the world.

							<h3 class="major">Reflection on GitHub</h3>
							<p>Using GitHub in a group was surprisingly easy and stress-free. At first it did seem a bit daunting having multiple people uploading at once, but working on individual sections definitely made it a lot easier to work with. Everyone played their part on GitHub and assisted with the finalisation of the website which was great to see. <br><br>
								There didn’t really seem to be too many issues with how the website was working and whatnot and GitHub’s pushing, pushing functions through GitHub Desktop made it extremely easy and straightforward.<br><br>
								Everyone’s contributions towards the repository also made it extremely easy. The use of comments and having titles that reflected the section that they were working on was extremely helpful, alongside with comments as everyone was pushing to the repo, so we were continually updated with what was being completed and why it was being pushed to the origin.
