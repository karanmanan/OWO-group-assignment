										<h2 class="major">Eric Chau</h2>
										<p>I’m a 23-year-old Chinese/Vietnamese student who was born and raised in the beautiful city of Melbourne.
											I spend most of my time playing video games or working out. The game that I am heavily playing is League of Legends, (whether it’s for enjoyment or just out of addiction is up to you) when I’m not playing LoL I generally enjoy playing action RPGs. <br><br>
											When games aren’t on the top of my mind, I’m usually working out. I spend 4 days a week training as I am a competitive powerlifter. A sport where contestants compete for the largest total in the squat, bench, and deadlift. <br><br>
											My main interest in IT began in 2012, when I was able to build my own PC which I have only just recently upgraded. I also find enjoyment in picking parts and building PCs for my friends and family. Just recently though, a lot of my interest in IT has stemmed from AI and how a lot of what we use today have AI integration without us thinking about it.
											Studying at RMIT will in hopes lead me in a direction with the right skillset and mindset once graduating university.

										<h2 class="major">Jacob Conley</h2>
										<p>My background is Australian. I like to play games in particularly League of Legends, Draw and create with digital creation software.
										My interest in IT had been developed from a young age admittedly on front-end programs to create like Maya, Adobe Creative Suite and Unity.
										Recently I have had the desire to continue learning about more back-end technologies in IT and develop my overall knowledge further.
										I have studied experience of a Cert IV in IT and a Diploma of Interactive media but overall, its limited and needs to be developed further
										hence the interest in IT.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Karanvir Manan</h2>
										<p>My name is Karanvir Singh Manan(S3905930). I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.
											I grew up in the state of Punjab in northern India and moved to Australia in 2016.
											I graduated from Melton Secondary College in 2020. I am fluent in Punjabi, Hindi, and English.
											I can get very motivated and very lazy depending on my mood. My hobbies are sketching, soccer and listening to music.
											I got interested in technology when I was around 10 years old, when my father bought me a Tetris game.

										<h2 class="major">Danny Nguyen</h2>
										<p>Hi my name is Danny Nguyen and my student code is s3900170. I am 18 years old and I like to workout and improve my health on a daily basis! I love computers, computers are like  toys, fun to play with and makes you happy overall. IT has many different aspects to it but what I like about it is the computer system side to it, like figuring out what PC designs are good, there are so many ways you can build a PC, from small to big or from cheap to expensive. There is so much that PC hardware can do and on top of that IT is the future of society as we are reliant on IT nowadays. I can’t wait to explore future PC hardware because there is so much to offer with creativity building, it’s like creating your own recipe! I am studying a bachelors of IT at RMIT so that I am able to focus on becoming a Technician to help with PC hardware. I So far know how to do a bit of coding with python and PC hardware in terms of Bit coding/Hardware. Hoping I can grow my knowledge to become a better IT Technician.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Ghania Tariq</h2>
										<p>My name is Ghania Tariq, and I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Business (Accounting) at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I was born and raised in Pakistan, then in 2016 I came to Australia. I completed my secondary school in Pakistan before moving to Australia to pursue my higher studies. Painting is one of my favourite hobbies, and I also enjoy listening to music, photography and visiting new places. In terms of languages, I can communicate in English, Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, and can read Arabic. At first I thought I’ll do some business only related course and it just struck me back then how I always wanted to know how all these application in any mobile device work or how exactly a computer operates and I should not only train myself to be good in the business side but also the technology point of view, and other major things that gave me an idea of opting for a business course combined with IT touch in it and that’s exactly how my interest in IT field expanded.
